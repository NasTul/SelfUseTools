What are the differences between Discretionary Access Control (DAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC).:

DAC has users and groups, permissions set by users for their files, users grant sharing permissions to other users on the same system.
MAC has subjects, objects and permissions set by a central policy administrator. Policy rules govern sharing of information.
---DAC has users, groups and permissions while MAC has subjects, objects and permissions. MAC controls permissions from a central policy administrator while DAC allows users to set permissions on their own files.

---Users can only view data with a security level equal to or lower and can only write data with a security level equal to or higher than their own.
Users can only view data with a security level equal to or higher and can only write data with a security level equal to or lower than their own.
Users must ask permission from their manager to view and write any data.



Which access control model prevents conflicts of interests by categorising resources into conflict of interest classes and ensuring users can only access resources from one conflict of interest class.:

---Brewer and Nash Model
Biba model
Low Watermark Model
Clark-Wilson Model



You are a security researcher and find a bug in a piece of software and write a proof of concept to demonstrate how the bug can be exploited. How do you responsibly disclose the vulnerability?:

---You provide details of the bug, steps to exploit it and suggested fixes to the software vendor allowing a patch to be issued before publicising the details.
You upload your exploit proof of concept code to your GitHub profile with a detailed explanation of how to use it.



What policies should be adopted to securely administer a network of computers?:

---Least privilege access control
---Enforce strong passwords
---Use well known and well tested cryptographic libraries
---Patch systems



What strategies could a network admin take to minimise the attack surface of their network?:

---Segment networks with internal firewalls, DMZ for internet facing machines and isolate machines that don't need internet access
Block access to domains that are known to host malware.
---Monitor and filter communications by MAC address
---Implement spam mitigation



You are a security researcher and have been asked to conduct a penetration test, what should you do first?:

---Get written agreement from the customer.
Take detailed notes of the information discovered and techniques you used.
Use ping sweeping to enumerate all hosts on the network.
Fingerprint the network to determine what operating systems are in use.
Use known vulnerabilities to gain access to internal resources.



Kerberos is a protocol and software suit that _______?:

---authenticates users to a  service.
---authenticates services to users
confirms authenticity of data
ensures availability of users and services.



Windows BitLocker encrypts a computers boot volume?:

---False
True



Windows EFS, Truecryps, Bit Locker and Free Compusec are all types of what?:

---Secure storage
Encryption schemes
Trusted Platform Modules
Penetration testing platforms



What makes BitLocker, TrueCrypt and Free CompuSec vulnerable to cold boot attacks?:

---They all load encryption keys into memory as plain text during operation which can be read by an attacker with physical access.
They all store a copy of the password on the unencrypted part of the disk for comparison when a user logs in which can be read by an attacker with physical access.
They all check the correct password has been entered by sending the plain text input by the user over the internet.



What is sqlmap?:

A database management system.
---A tool that automates testing for SQL injection flaws.
An application for developers to test how long a database query takes to run.
An application to map all databases connected to the internet.



Which is true of the following sqlmap command:
sudo sqlmap -u "http://www.control.com:88/cdcol/search_action.php?title=&year=1991" --dbms=MySQL --threads=9 -D cdcol -p year -T userinfo -C creditcard --dump:

The database name is userinfo.
The table name is creditcard.
---Information contained in the creditcard column will be dumped.
Information contained in the cdcol column will be dumped.
